# simple ollama installer gui 

A simple, user-friendly Python GUI that checks if [Ollama](https://ollama.com) is installed on your system and whether a specific AI model (like `llama2`, `mistral`, etc.) is available locally.

If not, the app offers to install Ollama or the model interactively through a graphical interface â€” no terminal commands needed.
